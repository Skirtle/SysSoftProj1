To compile and run the VM, do the following:
    0. Make sure the files are all on Eustsis, otherwise it may not work properly
    1. Type "gcc proj1.c" (chance the proj1.c to the name of the source code file if needed)
    2. Then type "./a.out input.txt" (change input.txt to the file you wish to input if needed)
